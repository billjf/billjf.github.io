# Steps You Need to Take After Graduation to Land a Tech Job

If you're a TripleTen student or graduate, you know they offer a money-back guarantee if you don’t land a job in time. But the real question is: Do you want your money back, or do you want a career in tech?

For me… I needed a career with scalability, **not just a job!**

The truth? Job hunting was harder than the bootcamp. Passing courses was easy compared to facing a competitive market, self-doubt, and rejection.

**My biggest struggle? Recruiters.**
Why can’t they just email me when they move on with another candidate? Instead, you get ghosted for weeks—sometimes months—until you finally assume it’s a no. 

And let’s not even talk about sending in a video response only to hear nothing back. At times, job hunting made me feel hopeless and frustrated. Was it something personal?

**The reality of hiring processes**
Hiring teams get flooded with applications and move on once they’ve found enough candidates. But even recruiters have their struggles—they face pressure to pick the “right” hire. Still… where’s the courtesy?

**Job hunting was harder than my QA bootcamp.**
No one prepares you for constant rejection. But I kept applying, networking, and practicing on my weaknesses.

Eventually, I stopped stressing about answering interview questions "perfectly" and focused on what I knew:

✅ 18 years as an electrical lineman
✅ QA bootcamp knowledge
✅ Externship experience
✅ I even mention my fluency in Spanish
✅ All these things make me who I am

**What I learned:**
I learned that while I apply, I also needed to stay active. Instead of only applying through the Prentus portal that TripleTen uses, I used my QA course as **LEVERAGE** to create opportunities and land interviews. If I can get an interview and not lie about what I don't know but instead be perceived as coachable and valuable, I have a shot.

Companies want someone who fits their culture. If they see that, they’ll teach you the rest.

💡 Keep going. The right opportunity will come, but be willing to take entry-level positions, even if it’s not QA at the moment but still in the tech field.
